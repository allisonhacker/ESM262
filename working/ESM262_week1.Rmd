### Why I am taking this course:

Computing seems like a powerful tool in envrionmental science. I am interested in improving my programming and computer skills and learning how to apply computing methods to environmental management. I am also interested in being less intimidated by programming and computers in general. 

### Data science background:

I have done data management and analysis in Excel, Access, and GIS prior to coming to Bren. My only coding experience has come from ESM 206.
